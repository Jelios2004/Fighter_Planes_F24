Push 1 was creating the initial files and repository.

Push 2 was Jadyn Englett adding Task 2, which was a coin that only stays on screen for 5 seconds then disappears, and when collected adds a point to the score.

Push 3 was Brody Townsend. I edited the scripts for the Player and Game Manager to count the players lives, then created UI Text to show the player how many lives they have.

Push 4 was Brandon Wei adding Task 3, which was a heart that appears randomly on screen, then disappears after 3 seconds, if the player manages to catch the heart before it disappears, it adds a life to the player, up to 3 lives maximum.
